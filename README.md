Qno9: //Important//
You are given a sorted unique integer array nums.
A range [a,b] is the set of all integers from a to b (inclusive).
Return the smallest sorted list of ranges that cover all the numbers in the array exactly. That is, each element of nums is covered by exactly one of the ranges, and there is no integer x such that x is in one of the ranges but not in nums.
Each range [a,b] in the list should be output as:
"a->b" if a != b
"a" if a == b
Example 1:
Input: nums = [0,1,2,4,5,7]
Output: ["0->2","4->5","7"]
Explanation: The ranges are:
[0,2] --> "0->2"
[4,5] --> "4->5"
[7,7] --> "7"
Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,2,3,4,6,8,9]
Output: ["0","2->4","6","8->9"]
Explanation: The ranges are:
[0,0] --> "0"
[2,4] --> "2->4"
[6,6] --> "6"
[8,9] --> "8->9"

Input: num = 38
Output: 2
Explanation: The process is
38 --> 3 + 8 --> 11
11 --> 1 + 1 --> 2 
Since 2 has only one digit, return it.

Sort Colors
Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.
We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.
You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.
